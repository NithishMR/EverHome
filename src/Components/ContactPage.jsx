          The information set forth on this site is based upon information which
          we consider reliable, but because it has been supplied by third
          parties to our franchisees (who in turn supplied it to us), we cannot
          represent that it is accurate or complete, and it should not be relied
          upon as such. The offerings are subject to errors, omissions, changes,
          including price, or withdrawal without notice. All dimensions are
          approximate and have not been verified by the selling party and cannot
          be verified by Everhome. It is recommended that you hire a
          professional in the business of determining dimensions, such as an
          appraiser, architect, or civil engineer, to determine such
          information.
